# Gauge

Agile project backlog management spreadsheet.

## Description

**Gauge** is a user-friendly spreadsheet designed to simplify Agile project planning and estimation.

It targets small teams and individuals seeking a practical and accessible way to manage Agile projects without the overhead of complex software tools.

## Features

- **Quick Quotation Generation** : Effortlessly estimate project costs and timelines using Agile principles.
- **Backlog Organization** : Organize and prioritize your product backlog directly within the spreadsheet.
- **Customizable Workflows** : Adapt the spreadsheet to your team's unique Agile processes for maximum flexibility.

## Principles

A project can be divided into tasks and subtasks with the following properties :
- Application name;
- Group name;
- Priority level;
- Due date;
- Effort;
- Developer name;
- Phase number;
- Sprint number;
- Status code.

Unlike traditional Scrum, where story points are used for cost estimation, **Gauge** employs a more straightforward approach based on minimum man-days.

This method simplifies the estimation process by focusing on :

- Estimating the **absolute minimum time** required to complete a task.
- Multiplying it by an uncertainty factor to estimate the **medium and maximum times**.
- Using the maximum time to estimate the **financial costs**, facilitating project quotations for clients.

This approach allows teams to:
- Provide more accurate and straightforward estimates.
- Streamline the budgeting process for client-facing projects.
