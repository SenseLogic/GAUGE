# Gauge

Agile project backlog spreadsheet.

## Description

**Gauge** is a user-friendly spreadsheet designed to simplify Agile project planning and estimation.

It targets small teams and individuals seeking a practical and accessible way to manage Agile projects without the overhead of complex software tools.

## Features

- **Quick Quotation Generation** : Effortlessly estimate project costs and timelines using Agile principles.
- **Backlog Organization** : Organize and prioritize your product backlog directly within the spreadsheet.
- **Customizable Workflows** : Adapt the spreadsheet to your team's unique Agile processes for maximum flexibility.

## Principles

A project can be divided into tasks and subtasks with the following properties :
- Application name.
- Feature group name.
- Priority.
- Due date.
- Estimated effort.
- Assigned developer.
- Release phase.
- Development sprint.
- Status.

Unlike traditional Scrum, which relies on story points for cost estimation, **Gauge** adopts a simpler and more direct approach based on **minimum man-days**.

This method streamlines the estimation process by:

- Evaluating the **absolute minimum time** required to complete each task, considering the least amount of effort below which the task cannot be executed.
- Applying an **uncertainty factor** (e.g., 2 or higher) to estimate the **maximum time** needed.
- Using these estimates to calculate **financial costs**, facilitating project quotations for clients.

This approach allows teams to :
- Provide more accurate and straightforward estimates.
- Streamline the budgeting process for client-facing projects.
